- **Andrej Karpathy:** Emphatically endorsed the term, noting that "context engineering is the delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information for each step."
- **Simon Willison:** Documented the rapid spread of the concept through technical communities and enterprise implementations.

### 1.2 Redefining Success Metrics

The industry has fundamentally redefined what constitutes successful AI implementation:

**Old Paradigm (Pre-July 2025):**
- Success measured by prompt cleverness
- Focus on individual model interactions
- Ad-hoc information management
- Limited scalability considerations

**New Paradigm (July 2025 Forward):**
- Success measured by context system architecture
- Focus on comprehensive information ecosystems
- Systematic context lifecycle management
- Enterprise-scale context engineering frameworks

### 1.3 The Three-Layer Context Revolution

Industry practitioners have converged on a structured approach to context engineering:

1. **Foundational Context Layer:** Static knowledge bases and organizational memory
2. **Integration Context Layer:** Dynamic data sources via RAG, APIs, and real-time feeds
